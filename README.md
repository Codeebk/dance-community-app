## Next Steps
User is able to only edit an event that they posted
Responsive
Require user to input all details before creating event
Display events in chronological order
Correct styling of homepage before a user is logged in (formatting is correct once logged in)
Add footers
Correct update event functionality to work as it did in previous table format. Right now the events page is displaying 2 cards for an event (the old version and the new version.)
